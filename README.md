# WSGI Calculator

Your assignment is to create a WSGI calculator that you can use to add, subtract, multiply, or divide two numbers.

You'll use the calculator by visiting an address like: [http://localhost:8080/multiply/3/5](http://localhost:8080/multiply/3/5). Once you've completed the assignment, if you were to run the program and visit this page then you would expect to see a page in your browser with the text "15".

You'll also have to create one more page: an index page at the address http://localhost:8080/ with some text instructions that explain (in just a few sentences) how to use the site.

## How to Know When You're Done

When you have completed the TODOs, you should be able to visit the following pages and see a page with the indicated content.:
  * http://localhost:8080/multiply/3/5  => 15
  * http://localhost:8080/add/23/42  => 65
  * http://localhost:8080/subtract/23/42  => -19
  * http://localhost:8080/divide/22/11  => 2
  * http://localhost:8080/  => Here's how to use this page... (etc.)

There is also a set of tests for you to run, using `python tests.py`.
